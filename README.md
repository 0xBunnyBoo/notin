Signatures are a way to authorize actions without sending a transaction. Marketplace signatures are used to list assets for sale on marketplaces like OpenSea. Permit signatures are used to grant token approvals. Because these signatures are not stored on the blockchain, there is no way for Revoke.cash to know if you signed them. This page contains a list of marketplaces and a list of your tokens that support offchain Permit signatures. Only if you know that you signed an offchain signature on a scam website, you need to cancel the potential signatures on this page, otherwise you are wasting transaction fees. When you cancel potential signatures for a token or marketplace, they will remain in the list but cannot be cancelled again for some time.
